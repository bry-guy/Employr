            "I'm looking to work full time as a junior Mobile Developer, either remotely or based in Seattle, Washington.  " +
            "I've created Employr to demonstrate my skills, work ethic, and passion for Mobile Development.  " +
            "Outside of the professional world, I cook (sometimes poorly), and tinker on personal projects.  " +
            "Thanks for downloading Employr - if you'd like to learn more about myself or this app, please keep reading and poke around, and feel free to contact me. I hope to see you around Xamarin Evolve, 2016! \n\n" +

            "I began coding to improve my efficiency as a Civil Engineer at my previous job, but (unsurprisingly) found myself enjoying the coding as much as the prospect of being a more productive engineer.  " +
            "As a lifelong nerd who built PCs and played video games from childhood to now, it felt natural to make the jump to software engineering full-time.  " +
            "Since leaving my previous job on April 1st, 2016, I have completed the Xamarin Certification course through Xamarin University.  " +
            "I will be continuing my programming education through Xamarin and a variety of free academic sources after Evolve.  " +
            "If you have any interest in bringing me on a project, whether it be full-time, contract, or open-source work, let me know!  \n\n" +

            "Employr was developed in concert with my education through Xamarin University, over the course of approximately three (3) weeks.  " +
            "I will be continuing work on this app to apply the skills and knowledge I am steadily learning, and will continue to support iOS and Android.  " +
            "So if you find anything here interesting, keep an eye out for updates/expansions to the app!  \n\n" +

            "I will be relocating to Seattle, Washington this coming fall and will be looking for full time work either in that area or remotely.  " +
            "I'm a hard-working, motivated, smart individual with a strong background in math, science, and engineering, and I'm excited to find a future home in the software world! \n\n \n\n" +
